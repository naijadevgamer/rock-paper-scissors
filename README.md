## My Process

I utilized HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript to bring this project to life. Attention to detail was crucial to mimic the provided design as closely as possible while ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience. Here are some highlights:

### Built With

- HTML
- SCSS (Sass)
- JavaScript

### What I Learned

Throughout this project, I honed my skills in writing clean, maintainable code by adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Additionally, I delved deeper into JavaScript to ensure an optimal user experience and learned how to make my code even more efficient.

### Continued Development

I'm planning to introduce sound features and a reset score option in the future to further enhance the gaming experience. Continuously refining my JavaScript skills to write even cleaner and more efficient code remains a priority.
