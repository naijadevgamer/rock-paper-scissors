## My Process

I utilized HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript to bring this project to life. Attention to detail was crucial to mimic the provided design as closely as possible while ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience. Here are some highlights:

### Built With

- **HTML & SCSS** (Sass) - To structure and style the game interface, making it visually appealing and responsive. üé®
- **JavaScript** - For handling game logic, player interactions, and DOM manipulations. üñ•Ô∏è

### üìö Features

- **Classic and Extended Modes**: Choose between the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors mode and the extended Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock mode. üïπÔ∏è
- **Player and House Picks**: Both the player and the house make their picks, with icons displayed on the screen. The game then determines the winner based on the chosen options. üèÜ
- **Dynamic Status Display**: The game dynamically displays the result of each round, informing the player whether it's a tie, win, or loss. üí¨
- **Score Tracking**: Your score is tracked across games and saved in the browser‚Äôs local storage, so you can always see how well you're doing! üìà
- **Play Again Option**: After each round, easily start a new game to continue the fun. üîÑ
- **Responsive UI**: The game features a us

### What I Learned

Throughout this project, I honed my skills in writing clean, maintainable code by adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Additionally, I delved deeper into JavaScript to ensure an optimal user experience and learned how to make my code even more efficient.

### Continued Development

I'm planning to introduce sound features and a reset score option in the future to further enhance the gaming experience. Continuously refining my JavaScript skills to write even cleaner and more efficient code remains a priority.
